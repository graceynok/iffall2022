        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Hello! My name is Grace Ok and I am a junior majoring in Communication Design and minoring in Business of Art.</p>
        <p>2. Although this class is part of the Communication Design curriculum, I've always wanted to learn more about how my designs can be integrated with computer science. In addition, since CS in general is one of the upcoming skills many UX/UI designers look for, I'd love to add HTML/CSS coding to my list of skill and experience. I've had minimal coding experience a couple years ago and I'd like to seriously learn how to code and create something again. </p>
        <p>3. I have light experience with HTML/CSS with the program, Brackets, from four years ago. I understand the general difference and function between HTML and CSS, but since it has been awhile, I'd like to learn AND retain new information.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn how to be more comfortable with HTML/CSS. The idea of coding is intimidating in my head so I'd like to be more confident and comfortable with it. </p>
        <p>5. I expect designing for screen to be more meticulous. On paper, you can erase or cross out a design if it doesn't work. On screen, I imagine myself scouring through the codes to see what/why it's not working or the way I'd like it to. From my past experience, I imagine designing on screen may be more frustrating than designing on paper.</p>
        <p>6. https://www.unleashed.company Unleashed's colorful and modern design has sleek buttons and interactive scroll that keeps the audience interested. It also showcases a unique design style with its color palette and bold fonts. </p>
        <p>7. https://calendly.com Calendly's clean and straightforward design attributes to its effective communication. It begins the website with a clear Call to Action button then splits up the company's information in an organized manner.</p>
        <p>8. https://www.celsius.com Celsius' website works well because it grabs the audience's attention with a bright picture slideshow of their newest product. Then displays other relevant information after while sticking with the company font and colors throughout.</p>
