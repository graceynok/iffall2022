        <h2>Description: “spaghetti with garlic and oil.”</h2>
        <p>Aglio e Olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Naples. It is a typical dish of Neapolitan cuisine and is widely popular. Its popularity can be attributed to it being simple to prepare and the fact that it makes use of inexpensive, readily available ingredients that have long shelf lives in a pantry. No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike because of its simple process that can be easily altered.

        <h2>Ingredients (2 servings):</h2> 
        <p>garlic (aglio): 4-8 cloves (traditionally) but up to personal preference</p>
        <p>olive oil (olio): 1/4 cup</p>
        <p>spaghetti: 1/2 pound linguine, fettucine, or other shapes of pasta</p>
        <p>red hot chile peppers / crushed red pepper flakes: 1/8 teaspoon or to taste</p>
        <p>salt and peper: to taste</p>
        <p>parmesan cheese (optional): 1/2 cup</p>
        <p>parsley (optional): 2 tablespoons</p>

        <h2>Equipment:</h2>
        <p>Pot and Pan</p>

        <h2>Total Time: 20 minutes</h2>
        <p>Prep time: 5 minutes</p>
        <p>Cook time: 15 minutes</p>

        <h2>Intructions:</h2>
        <p> Step 1: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.</p>
        <p> Step 4: Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>

        <h2>Three Recipe Links:</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222000/spaghetti-aglio-e-olio/">Allrecipes</a></h3>
        <p>Allrecipes is a good reference because it displays a variety of interactive elements. One I like most is the check off buttons for each step of the instructions. They also include video tutorials and photos of the pasta in the gallery.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/spaghetti-aglio-e-olio">Love & Lemons</a></h3>
        <p>Love & Lemons is a good reference because the aesthetic of the website is on brand and consistent. The font choice and small decorative designs compliment the brand image well and works in unison with the pictures.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/spaghetti-aglio-e-olio-recipe-2043225">Food Network</a></h3>
        <p>Food Network is a good reference because similar to Allrecipes it has the interactive buttons. In addition it displays the core information in a condensed and "straight to the point" style. While having description and the history is important, to simply cook the meal this has the most minimalistic layout.</p>

        <h2>Three Non-Recipe Links</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://zyro.com/preview/ginza">Ginza</a></h3></h3>
        <p>Ginza's style is a great example of what I envision my design to look like. I enjoy the large pictures and texts throughout the home page. In addition, I like the scroll of the main page is easily understandable and organized well.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://adamandrascik.com/">Adam Andrascik</a></h3></h3>
        <p>Adam Andrascik's website gives a modern minimal style. I like the simple layout of the brand on one side of the page and the products on the left. In addition, I love when you hover over the cropped pictures on the left, it shows the full image, then goes back to its stacked cropped pictures.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://hassler.io/">Jürgen Hassler</a></h3></h3>
        <p>Jürgen Hassler's portfolio website gives a generally minimal style with a pop of color. I think the pop of color is refreshing to the minimal color palette and general "flat" interface. I like how he added lines and relatively large fonts and large line spacings which is relieving to the viewer's eye.</p>
